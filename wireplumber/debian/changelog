wireplumber (0.4.5.r19.g147f235-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
    - Fixed a crash that could happen after a node linking error (#76)
    - Fixed a bug that would cause capture streams to link to monitor ports
      of loopback nodes instead of linking to their capture ports
    - Fixed a needless wait that would happen on applications using the pipewire
      ALSA plugin (#92)
    - Fixed an issue that would cause endless rescan loops in policy-node and
      could potentially also cause other strange behaviors in case pavucontrol
      or another monitoring utility was open while the policy was rescanning (#77)
    - Fixed the endpoints-based policy that broke in recent versions and improved
      its codebase to share more code and be more in-line with policy-node
    - The semicolon character is now escaped properly in state files (#82)
    - When a player requests encoded audio passthrough, the policy now prefers
      linking to a device that supports that instead of trying to link to the
      default device and potentially failing (#75)
    - Miscellaneous robustness fixes in policy-node

wireplumber (0.4.4.r14.g51713d3-3~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
    - Implemented linking nodes in passthrough mode, which enables encoded
      iec958 / dsd audio passthrough
    - Streams are now sent an error if it was not possible to link them to
      a target (#63)
    - When linking nodes where at least one of them has an unpositioned channel
      layout, the other one is not reconfigured to match the channel layout;
      it is instead linked with a best effort port matching logic
    - Output route switches automatically to the latest one that has become
      available (#69)
    - Policy now respects the 'node.exclusive' and 'node.passive' properties
    - Many other minor policy fixes for a smoother desktop usage experience
    - For more, See : https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/releases

wireplumber (0.4.2-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
     
       - Requires PipeWire 0.3.32 or later at runtime
       - Configuration files are now installed in $PREFIX/share/wireplumber, along
         with scripts, following the paradigm of PipeWire
       - State files are now stored in $XDG_STATE_HOME instead of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
       - Added new ``file-monitor-api`` module, which allows Lua scripts to watch
         the filesystem for changes, using inotify
       - Added monitor for MIDI devices
       - Added a ``system-lua-version`` meson option that allows distributors to
         choose which Lua version to build against (``auto``, ``5.3`` or ``5.4``)
       - wpipc has been removed and split out to a separate project,
         https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/pipewire-ic-ipc/

wireplumber (0.4.1.1-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Initial Release

  wireplumber - 
    
    Fixes:

      - Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with PipeWire 0.3.31
      - Fixed a potential livelock condition in si-audio-adapter/endpoint where
        the code would wait forever for a node's ports to appear in the graph
      - Fixed granting access to camera device nodes in flatpak clients connecting
        through the camera portal
      - Fixed a lot of issues found by the coverity static analyzer
      - Fixed certain race conditions in the wpipc library
      - Fixed compilation with GCC older than v8.1

    Scripts:

      - Added a policy script that matches nodes to specific devices based on the
        "media.role" of the nodes and the "device.intended-roles" of the devices

    Build system:

      - Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already using 2.62 API
      - Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire subproject
      - Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
      - The CI now also verifies that the build works on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
        and tries multiple builds with different build options
