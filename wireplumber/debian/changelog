wireplumber (0.4.1-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Initial Release

  wireplumber - 
    
    Fixes:

      - Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with PipeWire 0.3.31
      - Fixed a potential livelock condition in si-audio-adapter/endpoint where
        the code would wait forever for a node's ports to appear in the graph
      - Fixed granting access to camera device nodes in flatpak clients connecting
        through the camera portal
      - Fixed a lot of issues found by the coverity static analyzer
      - Fixed certain race conditions in the wpipc library
      - Fixed compilation with GCC older than v8.1

    Scripts:

      - Added a policy script that matches nodes to specific devices based on the
        "media.role" of the nodes and the "device.intended-roles" of the devices

    Build system:

      - Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already using 2.62 API
      - Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire subproject
      - Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
      - The CI now also verifies that the build works on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
        and tries multiple builds with different build options
