wireplumber (0.4.7.r6.gef7504b-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
    0.4.6

      -
      - Fixed a lot of race condition bugs that would cause strange crashes or
        many log messages being printed when streaming clients would connect and
        disconnect very fast (#128, #78, ...)
      - Improved the logic for selecting a default target device (#74)
      - Fixed switching to headphones when the wired headphones are plugged in (#98)
      - Fixed an issue where ``udevadm trigger`` would break wireplumber (#93)
      - Fixed an issue where switching profiles of a device could kill client nodes
      - Fixed briefly switching output to a secondary device when switching device
        profiles (#85)
      - Fixed ``wpctl status`` showing default device selections when dealing with
        module-loopback virtual sinks and sources (#130)
      - WirePlumber now ignores hidden files from the config directory (#104)
      - Fixed an interoperability issue with jackdbus (pipewire#1846)
      - Fixed an issue where pulseaudio tcp clients would not have permissions to
        connect to PipeWire (pipewire#1863)
      - Fixed a crash in the journald logger with NULL debug messages (#124)
      - Enabled real-time priority for the bluetooth nodes to run in RT (#132)
      - Made the default stream volume configurable
      - Scripts are now also looked up in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireplumber/scripts
      - Updated documentation on configuring WirePlumber and fixed some more
        documentation issues (#68)
      - Added support for using strings as log level selectors in WIREPLUMBER_DEBUG
      -
  
   0.4.7

     - 
     - Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the selection of the default audio
       sources and sinks to be delayed until some event, which effectively caused
       losing audio output in many circumstances (#148, #150, #151, #153)
     - Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the echo-cancellation pipewire
       module (and possibly others) to not work
     - A default sink or source is now not selected if there is no available route
       for it (#145)
     - Fixed an issue where some clients would wait for a bit while seeking (#146)
     - Fixed audio capture in the endpoints-based policy
     - Fixed an issue that would cause certain lua scripts to error out with older
       configuration files (#158)

wireplumber (0.4.5.r46.ge04acbd-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
  - Fixed a crash that could happen after a node linking error (#76)
  - Fixed a bug that would cause capture streams to link to monitor ports
    of loopback nodes instead of linking to their capture ports
  - Fixed a needless wait that would happen on applications using the pipewire
    ALSA plugin (#92)
  - Fixed an issue that would cause endless rescan loops in policy-node and
    could potentially also cause other strange behaviors in case pavucontrol
    or another monitoring utility was open while the policy was rescanning (#77)
  - Fixed the endpoints-based policy that broke in recent versions and improved
    its codebase to share more code and be more in-line with policy-node
  - The semicolon character is now escaped properly in state files (#82)
  - When a player requests encoded audio passthrough, the policy now prefers
    linking to a device that supports that instead of trying to link to the
    default device and potentially failing (#75)
  - Miscellaneous robustness fixes in policy-node
  - For more, See : https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/releases

  - docs: remove protected
  - annotations from functions to show them in the docs
  - policy: use a scheduleRescan function to avoid unneeded rescans
  - create-item: don't register item if failed to activate
  - si-std-link: handle node destroy events while linking is in progress
  - registry: ensure in-progress activations are aborted when a global is removed
  - pipewire-obj-mixin: guard against proxy being destroyed while syncing to core
  - core: add wp_core_sync_closure()
  - object-manager: doc: add note about the installed signal
  - log: guard against NULL messages
  - meson.build: add devenv
  - m-device-activation: reevaluate current profile if params changed
  - m-default-profile: only store the default profile if the save flag is present
  - m-mixer-api: unset iterator value before breaking or returning from loop
  - pipewire-object-mixin: enable feature info when event info is fully processed
  - metadata: unset iterator value before breaking or returning from loop

wireplumber (0.4.4.r14.g51713d3-3~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
    - Implemented linking nodes in passthrough mode, which enables encoded
      iec958 / dsd audio passthrough
    - Streams are now sent an error if it was not possible to link them to
      a target (#63)
    - When linking nodes where at least one of them has an unpositioned channel
      layout, the other one is not reconfigured to match the channel layout;
      it is instead linked with a best effort port matching logic
    - Output route switches automatically to the latest one that has become
      available (#69)
    - Policy now respects the 'node.exclusive' and 'node.passive' properties
    - Many other minor policy fixes for a smoother desktop usage experience
    - For more, See : https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/releases

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
     
       - Requires PipeWire 0.3.32 or later at runtime
       - Configuration files are now installed in $PREFIX/share/wireplumber, along
         with scripts, following the paradigm of PipeWire
       - State files are now stored in $XDG_STATE_HOME instead of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
       - Added new ``file-monitor-api`` module, which allows Lua scripts to watch
         the filesystem for changes, using inotify
       - Added monitor for MIDI devices
       - Added a ``system-lua-version`` meson option that allows distributors to
         choose which Lua version to build against (``auto``, ``5.3`` or ``5.4``)
       - wpipc has been removed and split out to a separate project,
         https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/pipewire-ic-ipc/

wireplumber (0.4.1.1-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Initial Release

  wireplumber - 
    
    Fixes:

      - Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with PipeWire 0.3.31
      - Fixed a potential livelock condition in si-audio-adapter/endpoint where
        the code would wait forever for a node's ports to appear in the graph
      - Fixed granting access to camera device nodes in flatpak clients connecting
        through the camera portal
      - Fixed a lot of issues found by the coverity static analyzer
      - Fixed certain race conditions in the wpipc library
      - Fixed compilation with GCC older than v8.1

    Scripts:

      - Added a policy script that matches nodes to specific devices based on the
        "media.role" of the nodes and the "device.intended-roles" of the devices

    Build system:

      - Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already using 2.62 API
      - Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire subproject
      - Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
      - The CI now also verifies that the build works on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
        and tries multiple builds with different build options
