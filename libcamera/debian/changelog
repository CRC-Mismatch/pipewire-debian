libcamera (0.r3373.g57c21712-2~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  * Disable lto (link time optimization) or test will always fail
  * Re-enable test and ignore if its failing harmlessly 
  * Dependency `libdrm-dev` added to find `libdrm` runtime pkgconfig
  * Remove `googletest` and `libgtest-dev` from build-depends
    as `gtest` is meson subproject that must be built at compile time.

  * Refactoring `debian/rules` file to make libcamera more maintaince free
    - Move subprojects/packagefile/* to debian/packagefile
    - Add debian/source/include-binaries to make debian.orig file with
      included tar file
    - Add patch file to disable downloadable url in subprojects/gtest.wrap
      due to launchpad buildd env do not allow to download even there is no
      internet connection.
    - Make sure version for gtest tar files under debian/packagefile and
      source/include-binaries is the same as gtest.wrap file
    .
    .
