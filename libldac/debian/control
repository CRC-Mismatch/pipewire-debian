Description: LDAC Bluetooth ABR library (development)
 LDAC is a lossy audio coding technology enabling the transmission
 of high-resolution audio content over a Bluetooth connection.
 .
 LDAC employs a hybrid coding scheme based on the modified discrete
 cosine transform to provide more efficient data compression.
 .
 LDAC is used by Bluetooth audio devices such as headphones, smart
 phones, portable media players, active speakers and home theaters.
 .
 This package ships development files for the LDAC Bluetooth ABR
 library.
